# 👋 Hi, I'm **Yash Kailas Doke**

🎓 **Computer Engineering undergrad** @ Savitribai Phule Pune University (2023–27)
📊 **CGPA:** 9.47 / 10

I’m building a bridge between **machine learning research** and **production-grade AI systems** — creating solutions that not only work in theory, but thrive in the real world.

My focus areas include **AI system design**, **multi-agent reinforcement learning**, and **scalable ML backends**. I’m fascinated by how intelligent systems evolve, adapt, and make decisions — and I enjoy turning those ideas into functioning prototypes and deployable architectures.
