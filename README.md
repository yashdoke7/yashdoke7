<!-- Profile README for Yash Kailas Doke -->

# Hi, I'm Yash Kailas Doke 👋

🎓 Computer Engineering undergrad @ Savitribai Phule Pune University (2023–27)  
📊 CGPA: **9.47 / 10**

I specialize in **Machine Learning, AI research, and scalable backend systems**.  
My work spans from fraud detection pipelines to ship-routing algorithms and research in AI-generated video detection.  
Always curious, I enjoy tackling real-world challenges with ML, data, and efficient engineering.

## 🔭 Projects & Research

### 🧩 AI-Generated Video Detection (Research Project)
- Built a **continual learning pipeline** for deepfake detection with **SigLIP transformers**.  
- Evaluated across **8 benchmark datasets** (DFDC, Celeb-DF, WildDeepfake, VidProM, etc.).  
- Processed **50K+ video samples**, achieving **92% AUC-ROC** with scalable architecture.

### ⚓ Ship Route Optimization (Full-Stack Application)
- Developed a **weather-aware pathfinding system** using a modified **A\*** algorithm.  
- Integrated real-time **OpenWeatherMap API** data (wind, sea, visibility).  
- Designed an interactive **Leaflet.js frontend** with live route visualization.

### 💳 Fraud Detection System (Production ML)
- Built ML services processing **50K+ daily transactions** with **96.2% accuracy**.  
- Used **XGBoost + Neural Networks**, advanced feature engineering, and class imbalance handling.  
- Deployed scalable microservices with **FastAPI** and a **React.js dashboard**.
